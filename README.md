# Shape Recognition and Classification with OpenCV

This script performs shape recognition and classification on input images using OpenCV. It identifies objects based on specific color. The script provides a visual representation of the shapes detected.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your input images in the same directory as the script.
3. Adjust the parameters according to the instructions provided for each image in the script comments.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python shape_recognition.py
```

The script will display the input image along with contours, bounding rectangles, shape labels, and size rankings.

## Notes

Make sure to follow the specific instructions provided for each image in the code comments. Adjust the parameters such as threshold values, kernel sizes, and iteration counts to optimize shape detection for different images.


Please replace `shape_recognition.py` with the actual filename if your script has a different name. You can also customize this README to include any additional information you think is relevant.
